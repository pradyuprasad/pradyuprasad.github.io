        It is tempting to think that <a

            China's Wolf Warrior diplomats </a> have no idea what they're doing. Sometimes they tell <a
            href="https://news.yahoo.com/put-mask-shut-chinas-undiplomatic-182915843.html"> Venezuelan lawmakers to
            "wear the masks and shut up" </a> . Or they're busy saying COVID-19 <a
            href="https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238269193427906560"> could have come from an American lab </a>.
        Whatever they do, they're in the middle of anything and everything.

        <br>

        It was not always like this. Chinese diplomats followed the idea of "Hide your capacities, bide your time" where they maintained a low profile and stayed out of the news. But what really was their intent, what was the <i>logic</i> behind this? Sulmaan Wasif Khan's book <a

        answers this very question.

        But, before we get into the book its important to understand the actual pandemonium that was 19th and 20th
        century
        China. If you don't want to read it click here <br>

        <h1>A little bit of history</h1>

        <h2>Qing Dynasty</h2>

        Imagine being a Chinese citizen through the 19th and 20th centuries The Qinq dyansty was humiliated. Foreign
        powers
        came
        and addicted your citizenry to opium. Then they lose not one but *two* Opium wars while having a 10x advantage
        over
        the
        British. In this they lost parts of Hong Kong and were forced to sign unequal trading treaties with the British.
        In
        between all of this was a civil war called the Taiping Rebellion which killed between 20 and 70 million people.

        They they lost almost 2 million square kilometres of land because the Russians threatened to start another war.
        Around
        20 years later they lost Taiwan.

        Just 11 years after all this you've gotten some peace and stability but there is another uprising in Wuchang
        that
        threatens to end the dynasty. This uprising spreads across the country and becomes a rebellion.  In between the
        year
        1911 and 1912 there are 38 internal rebellions, with around 200,000 people dying in them. This monarchy is
        dying,
        with
        complete chaos in the country.

        <h2>Republic of China</h2>

        This rebellion is successful, and a new republic is announced. This new Republic isn't doing too well either. To
        begin
        with, they aren't very "republic"-like. In the first democratic election, one of the candidates was assasinated.
        They
        could not even hold elections in Tibet and Outer Mongolia because they didn't have enough control over the
        states.
        Four
        years after the Republic is formed, the leader Yuan Shikai (who also was the assasin two sentences ago) died and
        another
        person Sun Yat-Sen became president. To cut a long story short the Republic of China, struggled for a long long
        time.
        They could not exercise power over the country, with rebellion and resistance all over.

        <h2>Communist Chaos</h2>

        While the ROC's army was going around trying to stop the scores of local overlords trying to defect, a new
        political
        party was being built in China - the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They had their first meeting between 23 and
        31st
        July 1921. In 1923, the Soviets sent people to China to establish communism. Initially the CCP and the KMT
        (Kuomintang -
        the party that was heading the Ghangzhou government at the time and later the enemy of the CCP in the Civil War)
        were
        allies in the sense that the left wing of the KMT believed in the same communist ideals as the CCP did. Sun
        Yat-Sen
        was
        a communist in economic ideology, but he died in 1925.

        Then Chiang Kai-Shek took over, a man who was firmly in the right wing of the party. By 1927, both the KMT and
        the
        CCP
        were preparing for combat.

        <h1>Strategy</h1>

        The real book reveiew begins here

        In 1931, Mao established the Jiangxi Soviet, where he proclaimed a new country. His focus was very simple here:
        to
        keep
        his state alive. There would be no compromise at all. As Khan notes

        > Mao’s overarching goal from this point on was simple: to keep his state alive. There would be no compromise on
        CCP
        sovereignty, no giving it away in the name of greater good.

        Here comes insight number 1 of the book:

        1. <b>**Have a fixed core principle and deviate from it only in the worst of the worst conditions.** </b>


        Mao really believed in this. After he'd fought so much for his CCP state, he did not want to give it up easily.

        Then the Japanese invaded China. For all practical purposes the CCP was immune from this, but they stopped
        hostilities
        for the time being. While this was happening, The CCP wanted to have strongholds over many parts of the country,
        so
        when
        the Japanese were defeated, they would have "many China's"
