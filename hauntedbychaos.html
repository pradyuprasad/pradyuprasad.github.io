            China's Wolf Warrior diplomats </a> have no idea what they're doing. Sometimes they tell <a

        <br>

        It was not always like this. Chinese diplomats followed the idea of "Hide your capacities, bide your time" where they maintained a low profile and stayed out of the news. But what really was their intent, what was the <i>logic</i> behind this? Sulmaan Wasif Khan's book <a

        answers this very question. <br> <br>

        But, before we get into the book its important to understand the actual pandemonium that was 19th and 20th century China. If you want to jump to the strategy section, click <a href="#Strategy">here</a>  <br>

        <h1 id="history">A little bit of history</h1>

        <h2>Qing Dynasty</h2>

        Imagine being a Chinese citizen through the 19th and 20th centuries The Qinq dyansty was humiliated. Foreign powers came and addicted your citizenry to opium. Then they lose not one but <em>two</em> Opium wars while having a 10x advantage over the British. In this they lost parts of Hong Kong and were forced to sign unequal trading treaties with the British. <br>


        In between all of this was a civil war called the Taiping Rebellion which killed between 20 and 70 million people. <br> <br>

        They they lost almost 2 million square kilometres of land because the Russians threatened to start another war. Around 20 years later they lost Taiwan.

        Just 11 years after all this you've gotten some peace and stability but there is another uprising in Wuchang that threatens to end the dynasty. This uprising spreads across the country and becomes a rebellion.  In between the year 1911 and 1912 there are 38 internal rebellions, with around 200,000 people dying in them. 
        <br> <br>
        This monarchy is dying, with complete chaos in the country.

        <h2>Republic of China</h2>

        This rebellion is successful, and a new republic is announced. This new Republic isn't doing too well either. To begin with, they aren't very "republic"-like. In the first democratic election, one of the candidates was assasinated. They could not even hold elections in Tibet and Outer Mongolia because they didn't have enough control over the states.
        Four  years after the Republic is formed, the leader Yuan Shikai (who also was the assasin two sentences ago) died and another person Sun Yat-Sen became president. To cut a long story short the Republic of China, struggled for a long long time.
        They could not exercise power over the country, with rebellion and resistance all over.

        <h2>Communist Chaos</h2>

        While the ROC's army was going around trying to stop the scores of local overlords trying to defect, a new political party was being built in China - the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They had their first meeting between 23 and 31st July 1921. In 1923, the Soviets sent people to China to establish communism. Initially the CCP and the KMT (Kuomintang - the party that was heading the Ghangzhou government at the time and later the enemy of the CCP in the Civil War) were
        allies in the sense that the left wing of the KMT believed in the same communist ideals as the CCP did. Sun Yat-Sen was a communist in economic ideology, but he died in 1925. <br> <br>

        Then Chiang Kai-Shek took over, a man who was firmly in the right wing of the party. By 1927, both the KMT and the CCP were preparing for combat.

        The real book reveiew begins here. <br> <br>

        In 1931, Mao established the Jiangxi Soviet, where he proclaimed a new country. His focus was very simple here: to keep his state alive. There would be no compromise at all. As Khan notes

        <blockquote>Mao’s overarching goal from this point on was simple: to keep his state alive. There would be no compromise on CCP sovereignty, no giving it away in the name of greater good.</blockquote> 

        Here comes insight number 1 of the book:

        <blockquote>1. <b>Have a fixed core principle and deviate from it only in the worst of the worst conditions.</b></blockquote>


        Mao really believed in this. After he'd fought so much for his CCP state, he did not want to give it up easily.
