# Haunted by Chaos: A Book Review

It is tempting to think that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomats-are-ready-to-fight-11589896722?mod=article_inline"> China's Wolf Warrior diplomats </a> have no idea what they're doing. Sometimes they tell <a href="[https://news.yahoo.com/put-mask-shut-chinas-undiplomatic-182915843.html"> Venezuelan lawmakers to "wear the masks and shut up" </a> . Or they're busy saying COVID-19 <a href="https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238269193427906560"> could have come from an American lab </a>. Whatever they do, they're in the middle of anything and everything. 

It was not always like this. Chinese diplomats followed the idea of "Hide your capacities, bide your time" where they maintained a low profile and stayed out of the news. But what really was their intent, what was the *logic* behind this? Sulmaan Wasif Khan's book [Haunted by Chaos](https://www.amazon.com/Haunted-Chaos-Chinas-Strategy-Jinping/dp/0674977092) answers this very question
